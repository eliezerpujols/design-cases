<p>Most designers participating in challenges like 100 Days UI Challenges because it feels great to break away for your day job and have a mental break, but just by making pretty UI without understanding and solving real problems will not give them some benefit.</p>

<p>For that reason I decided to make a collection of Design Cases, which not only give you the opportunity to break away for your day job and have a mental break but also give you the possibility to understand people's problems and experiment with different solutions.</p>

### How use it?

<p>Feel free of use Design Case as you want but I recommend to take one case for week because that will help you to focus on the problems and solutions.</p>

### Credits?

<p>Of course, this project was inspired by a UI Challenges of a great designer [Christian Vizcarra](https://dribbble.com/christianvizcarra){: target="_blank"} and thanks to [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) for the awesome photos.</p>
