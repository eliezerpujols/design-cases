Most designers participate in Design Challenges like “100 Days UI” because it does feel good to break away from your day job. The problem is, by just making a pretty UI without a deep or partial understanding of the problem won’t make them learn much.

For this same reason, I decided to make a collection of Design Cases. These cases give you an opportunity to practice an understanding of people’s problems and experiment with different solutions.

### Basic Usage

Use Design Cases as you want. I recommend you to take one design case per week because that helps you to focus on a problem.

### Contribute

Feel free to contribute to the project. Once you've finished designing the solution of a case upload it in our showcases section. Also, you're able to submit your own design case&nbsp;[here](http://bit.ly/2HS7zaY).

### Credits
