Most designers participating in challenges like 100 Days UI Challenges because it feels great to break away for your day job and have a mental break, but just by making pretty UI without understanding and solving real problems will not give them some benefit.

For that reason, I decided to make a collection of Design Cases, which not only give you the opportunity to practice more but also give you the possibility to understand people's problems and experiment with different solutions.

### Basic Usage

Use Design Case as you want but I recommend to take one case per week because that will help you to focus on the problem and design a great solution.

### Contribute

Feel free to contribute to the project and once you've finished designing the solution of a case upload it in our showcases section. Also you're able to submit as design cases as you want [here](http://bit.ly/2HS7zaY).

### Credits
