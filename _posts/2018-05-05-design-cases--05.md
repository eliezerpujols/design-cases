case_problem: >-
  Road trips are unpredictable and sometimes boring. Getting to the destination
  is awesome, but the process to getting there can be stressful even if you have
  planned the whole thing. Once road trip is over, you have nothing more than a
  couple pictures to show for.
case_solution: >-
  An app that helps to take the stress out of road-tripping by giving people an
  easy way to plan, enjoy and remember their adventures.
